# Install Scripts

Scripts for installing programs, that don't have installers nor entries in package managers.

## Installing a program

Read the [AVAILABLE.md](https://github.com/Simoso68/install-scripts/blob/main/AVAILABLE.md) file to see what applications are supported. \
If you found your wanted application, execute the App Selector by entering the following command. **MAKE SURE LUA IS INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM!**

```
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Simoso68/install-scripts/main/app-selector.lua | lua
```

You should now get a prompt asking you what you'd like to install. \
Enter the name of the program. **INFO: CASE-SENSITIVE** \
The installation process should start now.
